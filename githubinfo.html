<h2>Q. What is a version control system?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. A version control system is a software tool that helps in recording and tracking changes made to files by different developers. It has benefits such as improving productivity, reducing conflicts, and providing traceability. Learn about the types, purpose, and examples of version control systems.

<h2>Q. What is Git?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. A git is a distributed version control system that allows single/multiple developers to work on the same repository in an organized manner either online or offline. It allows developers to track changes in any set of computer files.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. What is Github?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. GitHub is a platform where developers can host, manage, and collaborate on code repositories, as well as access various tools and services to enhance their productivity and security.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. What is the difference between Git and Github?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. The difference between a git and GitHub is that Github allows access to gits and gits are distributed version control systems that allows single/multiple developers to work on the same repository in an organized manner either online or offline.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. Who started Github and how was it started?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. Chris Wanstrath and PJ Hyett started Github. It started when they worked for CNET and were tasked with maintaining and improving Ruby on Rails. The tedious, painstaking process of having to lobby trusted coders and convince them to commit changes/improvements became too much so they decided to create their own repository and it escalated from there.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. What company owns it now?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. Microsoft now owns Github.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. How much does a Github account cost?</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>A. A github account with limitations is free. For a full access/”Pro” account, you pay $4 a month or $48 a year.</dt>
    </dl>
<h2>Q. What is the Octocat?</h2>
    <dl>

<h2>Git/Github termanology (w/ definitions) </h2>
<dl>
    <dt style="font-size: larger;">Repository: <dt><br>A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.</dt></dt>
    <br><dt style="font-size: larger;">Commit: <dt><br>A commit is the same as the “save” feature in any other program.</dt></dt>
    <br><dt style="font-size: larger;">Fork: <dt><br>A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.</dt></dt>
    <br><dt style="font-size: larger;">Push: <dt><br>The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub.</dt>
    <br> <dt style="font-size: larger;">Pull Requests: <dt><br>They allow anyone to request for changes to be added, even if they don't have access to the repository.</dt>
    <br> <dt style="font-size: larger;">Workflows: <dt><br>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.</dt></dt>
    <br> <dt style="font-size: larger;">Issues: <dt><br>Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work.</dt></dt>
    <br><dt style="font-size: larger;">Raw Button: <dt><br>The Raw button opens the file in a raw form, meaning that any HTML formatting disappears.</dt></dt>
    <br> <dt style="font-size: larger;">Blame Button: <dt><br>The blame button allows you to select a given line of code, e.g. the 3rd line in my example, and work your way backwards up the commit events.</dt></dt>
